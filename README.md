# Enceladus
A MATLAB package to help with plotting, RF electronics, and many applications inbetween.

## How to Install
To install these functions, they only need to be accessible on the MATLAB path. The recommended way of achieving this is to move the contents of this Git repository to wherever you would like permanently keep them, then run the installer script. The installer script is a MATLAB script called 'install.m' which adds the functions directory to the MATLAB path. If you move the files again, you will need to rerun 'install.m' (I suggest also removing the previous directory from the path, however this is not necessary).

If you already curate a set of MATLAB functions in a folder on your device, you can copy all files in the subdirectores of this directory to that folder.
